Their black walls smirked with Jesus on black velvet
- Jesus, Elvis, Mexican skeletons, big-eyed Virgins,
Rodin's hands clasped in chocolate prayer -
an attitude of d√©cor, not like this room of yours.
A bottle opened - tequila with a cringe of worm -
and she watched me.
Lighting a meltdown of Paschal candles
she watched me. He poured the drinks rasping
We're seriously into cultural detritus. At which, at last,
she smiled. Ice cubes cracked. The worm sank in my glass.
And all that long year we were joined at the hip.
